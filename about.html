                                Hi! I'm Kyle Wadas, a Computer Science undergrad at Neumont College of Computer Science.
                            </p>

                                Born in Alaska and raised in rural Idaho, I was lucky enough to find my love for art and coding
                                despite the large agricultural setting around me.
                            </p>

                                Since enrolling at Neumont, I've participated and placed in three Game Jam events, and have been
                                on the President's List for academic excellence ever since starting college in 2022. I currently
                                hold a 3.8 GPA and am on track to graduate with a Bachelor's in Computer Science in  September,
                                2025.
                            </p>

                                I've primarily focused on expressing my artistic ideas through game development. My more
                                popular examples would be my work as lead artist for Game Jam projects like <i>BIG BLAST
                                OF ULTIMATE MUSCLE</i>, <i>BLOOD-DRIVE</i>, and <i>Spectres and Spirits</i>, all of which can be
                                found in my portfolio.
                            </p>

                                I've also delved into voice acting, which you can hear a bit of in
                                <i>ARMORED CANNIBAL</i>. I'm always looking for new ways to express my creativity!
